    "body": "Academic Free License (\"AFL\") v. 3.0\r\n\r\nThis Academic Free License (the \"License\") applies to any original work of\r\nauthorship (the \"Original Work\") whose owner (the \"Licensor\") has placed the\r\nfollowing licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original\r\nWork:\r\n\r\n  Licensed under the Academic Free License version 3.0\r\n\r\n1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\r\nnon-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n  a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a\r\n  collective work;\r\n\r\n  b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original\r\n  Work, thereby creating derivative works (\"Derivative Works\") based upon the\r\n  Original Work;\r\n\r\n  c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative\r\n  Works to the public, under any license of your choice that does not\r\n  contradict the terms and conditions, including Licensor's reserved rights\r\n  and remedies, in this Academic Free License;\r\n\r\n  d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\r\n\r\n  e) to display the Original Work publicly.\r\n\r\n2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\r\nnon-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled\r\nby the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the\r\nLicensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,\r\nhave made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.\r\n\r\n3) Grant of Source Code License. The term \"Source Code\" means the preferred\r\nform of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available\r\ndocumentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to\r\nprovide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along\r\nwith each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor\r\nreserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable\r\ncopy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to\r\npermit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor\r\ncontinues to distribute the Original Work.\r\n\r\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names\r\nof any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or\r\nservice marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\r\nOriginal Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as\r\nexpressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to\r\nLicensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other\r\nintellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer\r\nfor sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the\r\nlicensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks\r\nof Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in\r\nthis License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under\r\nterms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise\r\nwould have a right to license.\r\n\r\n5) External Deployment. The term \"External Deployment\" means the use,\r\ndistribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any\r\nway such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone\r\nother than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those\r\npersons or made available as an application intended for use over a network.\r\nAs an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat\r\nany External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a\r\ndistribution under section 1(c).\r\n\r\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative\r\nWorks that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the\r\nSource Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any\r\ndescriptive text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause\r\nthe Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent\r\nAttribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have\r\nmodified the Original Work.\r\n\r\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that\r\nthe copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein\r\nby Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the\r\nterms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those\r\ncopyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately\r\npreceding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an \"AS\r\nIS\" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without\r\nlimitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for\r\na particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK\r\nIS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this\r\nLicense. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except\r\nunder this disclaimer.\r\n\r\n8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,\r\nwhether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the\r\nLicensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or\r\nconsequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or\r\nthe use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss\r\nof goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\nother commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not\r\napply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\r\n\r\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this\r\nLicense, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this\r\nLicense and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate\r\ncopies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable\r\neffort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to\r\nthe terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake\r\nthe activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative\r\nWorks based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms\r\nand conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty.\r\nNothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and\r\nlimitations (including \"fair use\" or \"fair dealing\"). This License shall\r\nterminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted\r\nto You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section\r\n1(c).\r\n\r\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically\r\nand You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this\r\nLicense as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or\r\ncounterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work\r\ninfringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action\r\nalleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other\r\nsoftware or hardware.\r\n\r\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this\r\nLicense may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the\r\nLicensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under\r\nthe laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The\r\napplication of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\r\nInternational Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original\r\nWork outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be\r\nsubject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the\r\nappropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or\r\nseeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to\r\nrecover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable\r\nattorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including\r\nany appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be\r\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary\r\nto make it enforceable.\r\n\r\n14) Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this License,\r\nwhether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity\r\nexercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License.\r\nFor legal entities, \"You\" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by,\r\nor is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition,\r\n\"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or\r\nmanagement of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership\r\nof fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial\r\nownership of such entity.\r\n\r\n15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise\r\nrestricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not\r\nto interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\r\n\r\n16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence\r\nRosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License\r\nwithout modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this\r\nLicense as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You\r\nmay modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your\r\nmodified version (the \"Modified License\") and apply it to other original works\r\nof authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in\r\nany way that your Modified License is the \"Academic Free License\" or \"AFL\" and\r\nyou may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You\r\nmust replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice\r\n\"Licensed under <insert your license name here>\" or with a notice of your own\r\nthat is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You\r\nmay not claim that your original works are open source software unless your\r\nModified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You\r\ncomply with its license review and certification process."

    "body": "GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n                       Version 3, 19 November 2007\r\n\r\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\r\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\r\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\n                            Preamble\r\n\r\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\r\nsoftware and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure\r\ncooperation with the community in the case of network server software.\r\n\r\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\r\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\r\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\r\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\r\nsoftware for all its users.\r\n\r\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\r\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\r\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\r\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\r\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\r\nand/or modify the software.\r\n\r\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\r\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\r\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\r\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\r\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\r\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\r\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\r\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\r\nsource code to the public.\r\n\r\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\r\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\r\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\r\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\r\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\r\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\r\ncode of the modified version.\r\n\r\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\r\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\r\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\r\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\r\nthis license.\r\n\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\r\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n  0. Definitions.\r\n\r\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\r\n\r\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\r\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\r\n\r\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\r\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\r\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\r\n\r\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\r\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\r\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\r\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\r\n\r\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\r\non the Program.\r\n\r\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\r\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\r\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\r\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\r\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\r\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\r\n\r\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\r\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\r\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\r\n\r\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\r\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\r\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\r\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\r\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\r\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\r\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\r\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\r\n\r\n  1. Source Code.\r\n\r\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\r\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\r\nform of a work.\r\n\r\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\r\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\r\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\r\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\r\n\r\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\r\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\r\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\r\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\r\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\r\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\r\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\r\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\r\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\r\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\r\n\r\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\r\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\r\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\r\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\r\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\r\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\r\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\r\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\r\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\r\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\r\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\r\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\r\n\r\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\r\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\r\nSource.\r\n\r\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\r\nsame work.\r\n\r\n  2. Basic Permissions.\r\n\r\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\r\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\r\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\r\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\r\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\r\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\r\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\r\n\r\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\r\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\r\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\r\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\r\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\r\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\r\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\r\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\r\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\r\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\r\n\r\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\r\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\r\nmakes it unnecessary.\r\n\r\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\r\n\r\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\r\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\r\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\r\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\r\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\r\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\r\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\r\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\r\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\r\ntechnological measures.\r\n\r\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\r\n\r\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\r\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\r\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\r\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\r\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\r\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\r\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\r\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\r\n\r\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\r\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\r\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\r\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\r\n\r\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\r\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\r\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\r\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\r\n\r\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\r\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\r\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\r\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\r\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\r\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\r\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\r\n\r\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\r\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\r\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\r\n    work need not make them do so.\r\n\r\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\r\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\r\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\r\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\r\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\r\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\r\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\r\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\r\nparts of the aggregate.\r\n\r\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\r\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\r\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\r\nin one of these ways:\r\n\r\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\r\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\r\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\r\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\r\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\r\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\r\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\r\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\r\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\r\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\r\n\r\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\r\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\r\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\r\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\r\n    with subsection 6b.\r\n\r\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\r\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\r\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\r\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\r\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\r\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\r\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\r\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\r\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\r\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\r\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\r\n\r\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\r\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\r\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\r\n    charge under subsection 6d.\r\n\r\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\r\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\r\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\r\n\r\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\r\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\r\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\r\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\r\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\r\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\r\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\r\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\r\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\r\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\r\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\r\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\r\n\r\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\r\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\r\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\r\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\r\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\r\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\r\nmodification has been made.\r\n\r\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\r\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\r\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\r\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\r\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\r\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\r\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\r\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\r\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\r\nbeen installed in ROM).\r\n\r\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\r\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\r\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\r\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\r\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\r\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\r\nprotocols for communication across the network.\r\n\r\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\r\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\r\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\r\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\r\nunpacking, reading or copying.\r\n\r\n  7. Additional Terms.\r\n\r\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\r\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\r\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\r\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\r\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\r\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\r\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\r\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\r\n\r\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\r\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\r\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\r\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\r\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\r\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\r\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\r\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\r\n\r\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\r\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\r\n\r\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\r\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\r\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\r\n\r\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\r\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\r\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\r\n\r\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\r\n    authors of the material; or\r\n\r\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\r\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\r\n\r\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\r\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\r\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\r\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\r\n    those licensors and authors.\r\n\r\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\r\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\r\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\r\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\r\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\r\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\r\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\r\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\r\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\r\n\r\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\r\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\r\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\r\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\r\n\r\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\r\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\r\nthe above requirements apply either way.\r\n\r\n  8. Termination.\r\n\r\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\r\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\r\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\r\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\r\nparagraph of section 11).\r\n\r\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\r\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\r\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\r\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\r\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\r\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\r\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\r\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\r\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\r\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\r\nyour receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\r\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\r\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\r\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\r\nmaterial under section 10.\r\n\r\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\r\n\r\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\r\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\r\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\r\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\r\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\r\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\r\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\r\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\r\n\r\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\r\n\r\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\r\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\r\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\r\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\r\n\r\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\r\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\r\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\r\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\r\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\r\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\r\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\r\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\r\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\r\n\r\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\r\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\r\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\r\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\r\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\r\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\r\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\r\n\r\n  11. Patents.\r\n\r\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\r\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\r\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\r\n\r\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\r\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\r\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\r\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\r\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\r\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\r\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\r\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\r\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\r\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\r\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\r\n\r\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\r\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\r\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\r\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\r\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\r\npatent against the party.\r\n\r\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\r\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\r\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\r\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\r\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\r\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\r\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\r\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\r\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\r\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\r\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\r\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\r\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\r\n\r\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\r\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\r\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\r\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\r\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\r\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\r\nwork and works based on it.\r\n\r\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\r\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\r\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\r\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\r\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\r\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\r\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\r\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\r\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\r\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\r\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\r\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\r\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\r\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\r\n\r\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\r\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\r\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\r\n\r\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\r\n\r\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\r\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\r\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\r\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\r\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\r\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\r\n\r\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\r\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\r\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\r\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\r\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\r\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\r\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\r\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\r\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\r\nfollowing paragraph.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\r\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\r\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\r\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\r\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\r\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\r\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\r\n\r\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\r\n\r\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\r\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\r\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\r\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\r\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\r\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\r\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\r\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\r\nby the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\r\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\r\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\r\nto choose that version for the Program.\r\n\r\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\r\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\r\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\r\nlater version.\r\n\r\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\r\n\r\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\r\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\r\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\r\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\r\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\r\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\r\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\r\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\r\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\r\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\r\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\r\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\r\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\r\nSUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\r\n\r\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\r\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\r\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\r\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\r\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\r\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\r\n\r\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\r\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\r\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published\r\n    by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\r\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\r\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\r\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\r\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\r\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\r\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\r\nspecific requirements.\r\n\r\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\r\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\r\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\r\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>."

For the purposes of this definition,\r\n      \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the\r\n      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or\r\n      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the\r\n      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\r\n\r\n      \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity\r\n      exercising permissions granted by this License.\r\n\r\n      \"Source\" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,\r\n      including but not limited to software source code, documentation\r\n      source, and configuration files.\r\n\r\n      \"Object\" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\r\n      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\r\n      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\r\n      and conversions to other media types.\r\n\r\n      \"Work\" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\r\n      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\r\n      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\r\n      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\r\n\r\n      \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\r\n      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\r\n      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\r\n      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\r\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\r\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\r\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\r\n\r\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\r\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\r\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\r\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\r\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\r\n      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, \"submitted\"\r\n      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\r\n      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\r\n      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\r\n      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\r\n      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\r\n      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\r\n      designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\r\n\r\n      \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\r\n      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\r\n      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\r\n\r\n   2.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\r\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\r\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\r\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\r\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\r\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\r\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\r\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\r\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\r\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\r\n      meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\r\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\r\n\r\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n          stating that You changed the files; and\r\n\r\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\r\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\r\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\r\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\r\n          the Derivative Works; and\r\n\r\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\r\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\r\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\r\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\r\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\r\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\r\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\r\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\r\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\r\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

If the\r\nterms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to\r\nmake of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek\r\na different licensing arrangement.\r\n\r\nDefinitions\r\n\r\n    \"Copyright Holder\" means the individual(s) or organization(s)\r\n    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\r\n\r\n    \"Contributor\" means any party that has contributed code or other\r\n    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's\r\n    procedures.\r\n\r\n    \"You\" and \"your\" means any person who would like to copy,\r\n    distribute, or modify the Package.\r\n\r\n    \"Package\" means the collection of files distributed by the\r\n    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of\r\n    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard\r\n    Version, or a Modified Version.\r\n\r\n    \"Distribute\" means providing a copy of the Package or making it\r\n    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or\r\n    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\r\n\r\n    \"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing\r\n    this Package or providing support for this Package to another\r\n    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.\r\n\r\n    \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been\r\n    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested\r\n    by the Copyright Holder.\r\n\r\n    \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and\r\n    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright\r\n    Holder.\r\n\r\n    \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with\r\n    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as\r\n    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\r\n\r\n    \"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and\r\n    configuration files for the Package.\r\n\r\n    \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,\r\n    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or\r\n    translation of the Source form.\r\n\r\n\r\nPermission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\r\n\r\n(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\r\nModified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\r\nyou do not Distribute the Modified Version.\r\n\r\n\r\nPermissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\r\n\r\n(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\r\nStandard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\r\neither gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\r\nall of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At\r\nyour discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\r\nCompiled form of the Package.\r\n\r\n(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\r\nmodifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting\r\nPackage will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\r\nwill be subject to the Original License.\r\n\r\n\r\nDistribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\r\n\r\n(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\r\nor for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\r\nModified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\r\nfrom the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\r\nany non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\r\nyou do at least ONE of the following:\r\n\r\n    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder\r\n    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the\r\n    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard\r\n    Version.\r\n\r\n    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not\r\n    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In\r\n    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different\r\n    from the name of the Standard Version.\r\n\r\n    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to\r\n    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others\r\n    under\r\n\r\n\t(i)  the Original License or\r\n\r\n\t(ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\r\n\tmodify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same\r\n\tlicensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee\r\n\treceived, and requires that the Source form of the Modified\r\n\tVersion, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\r\n\tavailable in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor\r\n\tFees are allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDistribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version\r\nor Modified Versions without the Source\r\n\r\n(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\r\nthe Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\r\nget the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be\r\nvalid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\r\ntime while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\r\nmust provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\r\nIf you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\r\ndays after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\r\nyou do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\r\n\r\n(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\r\nthe Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\r\nthe Source of the Modified Version.\r\n\r\n\r\nAggregating or Linking the Package\r\n\r\n(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\r\nModified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\r\naggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\r\nPackage.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\r\ncomponents in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\r\napply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\r\nas included in the aggregation.\r\n\r\n(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\r\nother works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\r\nbuild stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\r\ninclude the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\r\nprovided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\r\n\r\n\r\nItems That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\r\n\r\n(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\r\nmerely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\r\nthe Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\r\nconsidered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\r\nterms of this license.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Provisions\r\n\r\n(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\r\nModified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\r\nmodifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\r\nuse, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\n(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\r\nVersion made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\r\nto ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\r\nthis license.\r\n\r\n(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\r\nservice mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\r\n\r\n(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\r\nfree-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\r\nsell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\r\npatent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\r\ninfringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\r\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\r\nthat the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\r\ninfringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\r\ndate that such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:\r\nTHE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\r\nIS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED\r\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR\r\nNON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL\r\nLAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL\r\nBE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL\r\nDAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF\r\nADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE."

The\r\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\r\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\r\n\r\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\r\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\r\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\r\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\r\n     irrevocable.

Licensors should clearly mark any\r\n     material not subject to the license.

More considerations for licensors:\r\n     wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\r\n\r\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\r\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\r\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\r\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\r\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\r\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\r\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\r\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\r\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\r\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\r\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\r\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\r\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\r\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

To the\r\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\r\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\r\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\r\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\r\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\r\n\r\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\r\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\r\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\r\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\r\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\r\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\r\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\r\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\r\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\r\n\r\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\r\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\r\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\n\r\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\r\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\r\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\r\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\r\n     categorized.

Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\r\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\r\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\r\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\r\n\r\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\r\n     under this Public License.\r\n\r\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\r\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\r\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\r\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\r\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\r\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\r\n     individually chosen by them.\r\n\r\n  j.

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\r\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 2 -- Scope.\r\n\r\n  a. License grant.\r\n\r\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\r\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\r\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\r\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\r\n\r\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\r\n               in part; and\r\n\r\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\r\n\r\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\r\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\r\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\r\n          its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\r\n          6(a).\r\n\r\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\r\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\r\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\r\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\r\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\r\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\r\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\r\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\r\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\r\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\r\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\r\n\r\n       5. Downstream recipients.\r\n\r\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\r\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\r\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\r\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\r\n               Public License.\r\n\r\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\r\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\r\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\r\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\r\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\r\n               Material.\r\n\r\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\r\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\r\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\r\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\r\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\r\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\r\n\r\n  b. Other rights.\r\n\r\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\r\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\r\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\r\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\r\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\r\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\r\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\r\n          Public License.\r\n\r\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\r\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\r\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\r\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\r\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\r\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\r\n\r\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\r\nfollowing conditions.\r\n\r\n  a. Attribution.\r\n\r\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\r\n          form), You must:\r\n\r\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\r\n               with the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\r\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\r\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\r\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\r\n                    designated);\r\n\r\n                ii. a copyright notice;\r\n\r\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\r\n\r\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\r\n                    warranties;\r\n\r\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\r\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\r\n\r\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\r\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\r\n\r\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\r\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\r\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\r\n\r\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\r\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\r\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\r\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\r\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\r\n          information.\r\n\r\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\r\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\r\n          reasonably practicable.\r\n\r\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\r\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\r\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\r\n\r\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\r\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\r\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\r\n     portion of the contents of the database;\r\n\r\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\r\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\r\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\r\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\r\n\r\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\r\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\r\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\r\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\r\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\r\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\r\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\r\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\r\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\r\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\r\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\r\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\r\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\r\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\r\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\r\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\r\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\r\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\r\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\r\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\r\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\r\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\r\n     waiver of all liability.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\r\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\r\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\r\n     terminate automatically.\r\n\r\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\r\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\n\r\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\r\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\r\n          violation; or\r\n\r\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\n\r\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\r\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\r\n     of this Public License.\r\n\r\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\r\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\r\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\r\n     will not terminate this Public License.\r\n\r\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\r\n     License.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\r\n\r\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\r\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\r\n\r\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\r\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\r\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\r\n\r\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\r\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\r\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\r\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\r\n\r\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\r\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\r\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\r\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\r\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\r\n     conditions.\r\n\r\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\r\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\r\n     Licensor.\r\n\r\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\r\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\r\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\r\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n=======================================================================\r\n\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.\r\nNotwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public\r\nlicenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be\r\nconsidered the “Licensor.” The text of the Creative Commons public\r\nlicenses is dedicated to the public domain under the CC0 Public Domain\r\nDedication.

The\r\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\r\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\r\n\r\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\r\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\r\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\r\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\r\n     irrevocable.

More considerations for licensors:\r\n     wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\r\n\r\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\r\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\r\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\r\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\r\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\r\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\r\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\r\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\r\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\r\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\r\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\r\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\r\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\r\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\r\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\r\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\r\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\r\n\r\n  b.

For purposes of this Public License, the rights\r\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\r\n     Rights.\r\n\r\n  e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\r\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\r\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\r\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\r\n     agreements.\r\n\r\n  f.

Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\r\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\r\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\r\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\r\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n  m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\r\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 2 -- Scope.\r\n\r\n  a. License grant.\r\n\r\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\r\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\r\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\r\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\r\n\r\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\r\n               in part; and\r\n\r\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\r\n\r\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\r\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\r\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\r\n          its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\r\n          6(a).\r\n\r\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\r\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\r\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\r\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\r\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\r\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\r\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\r\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\r\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\r\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\r\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\r\n\r\n       5. Downstream recipients.\r\n\r\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\r\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\r\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\r\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\r\n               Public License.\r\n\r\n            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.\r\n               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You\r\n               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to\r\n               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material\r\n               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\r\n\r\n            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\r\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\r\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\r\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\r\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\r\n               Material.\r\n\r\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\r\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\r\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\r\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\r\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\r\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\r\n\r\n  b. Other rights.\r\n\r\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\r\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\r\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\r\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\r\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\r\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\r\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\r\n          Public License.\r\n\r\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\r\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\r\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\r\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\r\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\r\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\r\n\r\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\r\nfollowing conditions.\r\n\r\n  a. Attribution.\r\n\r\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\r\n          form), You must:\r\n\r\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\r\n               with the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\r\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\r\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\r\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\r\n                    designated);\r\n\r\n                ii. a copyright notice;\r\n\r\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\r\n\r\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\r\n                    warranties;\r\n\r\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\r\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\r\n\r\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\r\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\r\n\r\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\r\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\r\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\r\n\r\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\r\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\r\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\r\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\r\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\r\n          information.\r\n\r\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\r\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\r\n          reasonably practicable.\r\n\r\n  b. ShareAlike.\r\n\r\n     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share\r\n     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\r\n\r\n       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons\r\n          license with the same License Elements, this version or\r\n          later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\r\n\r\n       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the\r\n          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition\r\n          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and\r\n          context in which You Share Adapted Material.\r\n\r\n       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms\r\n          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological\r\n          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the\r\n          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\r\n\r\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\r\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\r\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\r\n     portion of the contents of the database;\r\n\r\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\r\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\r\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\r\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,\r\n     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\r\n\r\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\r\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\r\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\r\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\r\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\r\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\r\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\r\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\r\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\r\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\r\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\r\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\r\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\r\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\r\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\r\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\r\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\r\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\r\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\r\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\r\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\r\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\r\n     waiver of all liability.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\r\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\r\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\r\n     terminate automatically.\r\n\r\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\r\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\n\r\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\r\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\r\n          violation; or\r\n\r\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\n\r\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\r\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\r\n     of this Public License.\r\n\r\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\r\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\r\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\r\n     will not terminate this Public License.\r\n\r\n  d.

Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\r\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\r\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not\r\nlimited to, the following:\r\n\r\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\r\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\r\n ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\r\niii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\r\n     likeness depicted in a Work;\r\n iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\r\n     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\r\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\r\n     in a Work;\r\n vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\r\n     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\r\n     protection of databases, and under any national implementation\r\n     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such\r\n     directive); and\r\nvii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\r\n     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national\r\n     implementations thereof.\r\n\r\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\r\nof, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\r\nirrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\r\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes\r\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as\r\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories\r\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or\r\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\r\nmedium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\r\nincluding without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\r\npurposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\r\nmember of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\r\nsuccessors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to\r\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or\r\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public\r\nas contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\r\n\r\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason\r\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the\r\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\r\naccount Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\r\nextent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\r\nperson a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\r\nirrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and\r\nRelated Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\r\nmaximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future\r\ntime extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number\r\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without\r\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\r\n\"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\r\napplied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\r\nreason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\r\npartial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\r\nof the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\r\nwill not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\r\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of\r\naction with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's\r\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\r\n\r\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\r\n\r\n a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\r\n    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\r\n b.

Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\r\n    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\r\n    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\r\n    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\r\n    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the\r\n    Work.\r\n d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\r\n    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to\r\n    this CC0 or use of the Work."

L'attention\r\ndu Licencié a été attirée sur ce point sur les risques associés au\r\nchargement, à l'utilisation, la modification et/ou au développement et à\r\nla reproduction du Logiciel qui sont réservés à des utilisateurs avertis.\r\n\r\nIl relève de la responsabilité du Licencié de contrôler, par tous\r\nmoyens, l'adéquation du produit à ses besoins, son bon fonctionnement et\r\nde s'assurer qu'il ne causera pas de dommages aux personnes et aux biens.\r\n\r\n9.2 Le Concédant déclare de bonne foi être en droit de concéder\r\nl'ensemble des droits attachés au Logiciel (comprenant notamment les\r\ndroits visés à l'article 5 <#etendue>).\r\n\r\n9.3 Le Licencié reconnaît que le Logiciel est fourni \"en l'état\" par le\r\nConcédant sans autre garantie, expresse ou tacite, que celle prévue à\r\nl'article 9.2 <#bonne-foi> et notamment sans aucune garantie sur sa\r\nvaleur commerciale, son caractère sécurisé, innovant ou pertinent.\r\n\r\nEn particulier, le Concédant ne garantit pas que le Logiciel est exempt\r\nd'erreur, qu'il fonctionnera sans interruption, qu'il sera compatible\r\navec l'équipement du Licencié et sa configuration logicielle ni qu'il\r\nremplira les besoins du Licencié.\r\n\r\n9.4 Le Concédant ne garantit pas, de manière expresse ou tacite, que le\r\nLogiciel ne porte pas atteinte à un quelconque droit de propriété\r\nintellectuelle d'un tiers portant sur un brevet, un logiciel ou sur tout\r\nautre droit de propriété. Ainsi, le Concédant exclut toute garantie au\r\nprofit du Licencié contre les actions en contrefaçon qui pourraient être\r\ndiligentées au titre de l'utilisation, de la modification, et de la\r\nredistribution du Logiciel. Néanmoins, si de telles actions sont\r\nexercées contre le Licencié, le Concédant lui apportera son expertise\r\ntechnique et juridique pour sa défense. Cette expertise technique et\r\njuridique est déterminée au cas par cas entre le Concédant concerné et\r\nle Licencié dans le cadre d'un protocole d'accord. Le Concédant dégage\r\ntoute responsabilité quant à l'utilisation de la dénomination du\r\nLogiciel par le Licencié. Aucune garantie n'est apportée quant à\r\nl'existence de droits antérieurs sur le nom du Logiciel et sur\r\nl'existence d'une marque.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 10 - RESILIATION\r\n\r\n10.1 En cas de manquement par le Licencié aux obligations mises à sa\r\ncharge par le Contrat, le Concédant pourra résilier de plein droit le\r\nContrat trente (30) jours après notification adressée au Licencié et\r\nrestée sans effet.\r\n\r\n10.2 Le Licencié dont le Contrat est résilié n'est plus autorisé à\r\nutiliser, modifier ou distribuer le Logiciel. Cependant, toutes les\r\nlicences qu'il aura concédées antérieurement à la résiliation du Contrat\r\nresteront valides sous réserve qu'elles aient été effectuées en\r\nconformité avec le Contrat.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 11 - DISPOSITIONS DIVERSES\r\n\r\n\r\n      11.1 CAUSE EXTERIEURE\r\n\r\nAucune des Parties ne sera responsable d'un retard ou d'une défaillance\r\nd'exécution du Contrat qui serait dû à un cas de force majeure, un cas\r\nfortuit ou une cause extérieure, telle que, notamment, le mauvais\r\nfonctionnement ou les interruptions du réseau électrique ou de\r\ntélécommunication, la paralysie du réseau liée à une attaque\r\ninformatique, l'intervention des autorités gouvernementales, les\r\ncatastrophes naturelles, les dégâts des eaux, les tremblements de terre,\r\nle feu, les explosions, les grèves et les conflits sociaux, l'état de\r\nguerre...\r\n\r\n11.2 Le fait, par l'une ou l'autre des Parties, d'omettre en une ou\r\nplusieurs occasions de se prévaloir d'une ou plusieurs dispositions du\r\nContrat, ne pourra en aucun cas impliquer renonciation par la Partie\r\nintéressée à s'en prévaloir ultérieurement.\r\n\r\n11.3 Le Contrat annule et remplace toute convention antérieure, écrite\r\nou orale, entre les Parties sur le même objet et constitue l'accord\r\nentier entre les Parties sur cet objet. Aucune addition ou modification\r\naux termes du Contrat n'aura d'effet à l'égard des Parties à moins\r\nd'être faite par écrit et signée par leurs représentants dûment habilités.\r\n\r\n11.4 Dans l'hypothèse où une ou plusieurs des dispositions du Contrat\r\ns'avèrerait contraire à une loi ou à un texte applicable, existants ou\r\nfuturs, cette loi ou ce texte prévaudrait, et les Parties feraient les\r\namendements nécessaires pour se conformer à cette loi ou à ce texte.\r\nToutes les autres dispositions resteront en vigueur. De même, la\r\nnullité, pour quelque raison que ce soit, d'une des dispositions du\r\nContrat ne saurait entraîner la nullité de l'ensemble du Contrat.\r\n\r\n\r\n      11.5 LANGUE\r\n\r\nLe Contrat est rédigé en langue française et en langue anglaise, ces\r\ndeux versions faisant également foi.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 12 - NOUVELLES VERSIONS DU CONTRAT\r\n\r\n12.1 Toute personne est autorisée à copier et distribuer des copies de\r\nce Contrat.\r\n\r\n12.2 Afin d'en préserver la cohérence, le texte du Contrat est protégé\r\net ne peut être modifié que par les auteurs de la licence, lesquels se\r\nréservent le droit de publier périodiquement des mises à jour ou de\r\nnouvelles versions du Contrat, qui posséderont chacune un numéro\r\ndistinct. Ces versions ultérieures seront susceptibles de prendre en\r\ncompte de nouvelles problématiques rencontrées par les logiciels libres.\r\n\r\n12.3 Tout Logiciel diffusé sous une version donnée du Contrat ne pourra\r\nfaire l'objet d'une diffusion ultérieure que sous la même version du\r\nContrat ou une version postérieure, sous réserve des dispositions de\r\nl'article 5.3.4 <#compatibilite>.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 13 - LOI APPLICABLE ET COMPETENCE TERRITORIALE\r\n\r\n13.1 Le Contrat est régi par la loi française.

Version 2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence comes in three\r\nvariants: this licence, CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and two reciprocal licences:\r\nCERN-OHL-W (weakly reciprocal) and CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).\r\n\r\nThe CERN-OHL-P is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in\r\nunmodified form only.\r\n\r\nUse of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any Licensor or\r\ntheir designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in their development.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Definitions\r\n\r\n  1.1 'Licence' means this CERN-OHL-P.\r\n\r\n  1.2 'Source' means information such as design materials or digital code\r\n      which can be applied to Make or test a Product or to prepare a Product\r\n      for use, Conveyance or sale, regardless of its medium or how it is\r\n      expressed. It may include Notices.\r\n\r\n  1.3 'Covered Source' means Source that is explicitly made available under\r\n      this Licence.\r\n\r\n  1.4 'Product' means any device, component, work or physical object, whether\r\n      in finished or intermediate form, arising from the use, application or\r\n      processing of Covered Source.\r\n\r\n  1.5 'Make' means to create or configure something, whether by manufacture,\r\n      assembly, compiling, loading or applying Covered Source or another\r\n      Product or otherwise.\r\n\r\n  1.6 'Notice' means copyright, acknowledgement and trademark notices,\r\n      references to the location of any Notices, modification notices\r\n      (subsection 3.3(b)) and all notices that refer to this Licence and to\r\n      the disclaimer of warranties that are included in the Covered Source.\r\n\r\n  1.7 'Licensee' or 'You' means any person exercising rights under this\r\n      Licence.\r\n\r\n  1.8 'Licensor' means a person who creates Source or modifies Covered Source\r\n      and subsequently Conveys the resulting Covered Source under the terms\r\n      and conditions of this Licence. A person may be a Licensee and a\r\n      Licensor at the same time.\r\n\r\n  1.9 'Convey' means to communicate to the public or distribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Applicability\r\n\r\n  2.1 This Licence governs the use, copying, modification, Conveying of\r\n      Covered Source and Products, and the Making of Products. By exercising\r\n      any right granted under this Licence, You irrevocably accept these terms\r\n      and conditions.\r\n\r\n  2.2 This Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to You, and shall apply\r\n      worldwide and without limitation in time.\r\n\r\n  2.3 You shall not attempt to restrict by contract or otherwise the rights\r\n      granted under this Licence to other Licensees.\r\n\r\n  2.4 This Licence is not intended to restrict fair use, fair dealing, or any\r\n      other similar right.\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Copying, Modifying and Conveying Covered Source\r\n\r\n  3.1 You may copy and Convey verbatim copies of Covered Source, in any\r\n      medium, provided You retain all Notices.\r\n\r\n  3.2 You may modify Covered Source, other than Notices.\r\n\r\n      You may only delete Notices if they are no longer applicable to the\r\n      corresponding Covered Source as modified by You and You may add\r\n      additional Notices applicable to Your modifications.\r\n\r\n  3.3 You may Convey modified Covered Source (with the effect that You shall\r\n      also become a Licensor) provided that You:\r\n\r\n       a) retain Notices as required in subsection 3.2; and\r\n\r\n       b) add a Notice to the modified Covered Source stating that You have\r\n          modified it, with the date and brief description of how You have\r\n          modified it.\r\n\r\n  3.4 You may Convey Covered Source or modified Covered Source under licence\r\n      terms which differ from the terms of this Licence provided that You:\r\n\r\n       a) comply at all times with subsection 3.3; and\r\n\r\n       b) provide a copy of this Licence to anyone to whom You Convey Covered\r\n          Source or modified Covered Source.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Making and Conveying Products\r\n\r\nYou may Make Products, and/or Convey them, provided that You ensure that the\r\nrecipient of the Product has access to any Notices applicable to the Product.\r\n\r\n\r\n5 DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY\r\n\r\n  5.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY -- The Covered Source and any Products are\r\n      provided 'as is' and any express or implied warranties, including, but\r\n      not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, of satisfactory\r\n      quality, non-infringement of third party rights, and fitness for a\r\n      particular purpose or use are disclaimed in respect of any Source or\r\n      Product to the maximum extent permitted by law. The Licensor makes no\r\n      representation that any Source or Product does not or will not infringe\r\n      any patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right. The\r\n      entire risk as to the use, quality, and performance of any Source or\r\n      Product shall be with You and not the Licensor. This disclaimer of\r\n      warranty is an essential part of this Licence and a condition for the\r\n      grant of any rights granted under this Licence.\r\n\r\n  5.2 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY -- The Licensor shall, to the\r\n      maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability for direct, indirect,\r\n      special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive or other damages\r\n      of any character including, without limitation, procurement of\r\n      substitute goods or services, loss of use, data or profits, or business\r\n      interruption, however caused and on any theory of contract, warranty,\r\n      tort (including negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in\r\n      any way in relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered Source\r\n      and/or the Making or Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of the\r\n      possibility of such damages, and You shall hold the Licensor(s) free and\r\n      harmless from any liability, costs, damages, fees and expenses,\r\n      including claims by third parties, in relation to such use.\r\n\r\n\r\n6 Patents\r\n\r\n  6.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each Licensor\r\n      hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,\r\n      royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section 6, or where\r\n      terminated by the Licensor for cause) patent licence to Make, have Made,\r\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Covered\r\n      Source and Products, where such licence applies only to those patent\r\n      claims licensable by such Licensor that are necessarily infringed by\r\n      exercising rights under the Covered Source as Conveyed by that Licensor.\r\n\r\n  6.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\r\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Covered\r\n      Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory patent\r\n      infringement, or You seek any declaration that a patent licensed to You\r\n      under this Licence is invalid or unenforceable then any rights granted\r\n      to You under this Licence shall terminate as of the date such process is\r\n      initiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n7 General\r\n\r\n  7.1 If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become invalid or\r\n      unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall remain\r\n      effective.\r\n\r\n  7.2 You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and\r\n      abbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor or CERN is known,\r\n      except where needed to comply with section 3, or where the use is\r\n      otherwise allowed by law. Any such permitted use shall be factual and\r\n      shall not be made so as to suggest any kind of endorsement or\r\n      implication of involvement by the Licensor or its personnel.\r\n\r\n  7.3 CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence which it\r\n      considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may differ in detail\r\n      to address new problems or concerns. New versions will be published with\r\n      a unique version number and a variant identifier specifying the variant.\r\n      If the Licensor has specified that a given variant applies to the\r\n      Covered Source without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered\r\n      Source as being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that\r\n      variant. If no variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be treated\r\n      as being released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor may also specify that\r\n      the Covered Source is subject to a specific version of the CERN-OHL or\r\n      any later version in which case You may apply this or any later version\r\n      of CERN-OHL with the same variant identifier published by CERN.\r\n\r\n  7.4 This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor acting as\r\n      such, and third party beneficiary rights are specifically excluded."

    "body": "CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal\r\n\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nCERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware\r\ndesigners and to provide a legal tool which supports the freedom to use,\r\nstudy, modify, share and distribute hardware designs and products based on\r\nthose designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence comes in three\r\nvariants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and two reciprocal licences: CERN-OHL-W\r\n(weakly reciprocal) and this licence, CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).\r\n\r\nThe CERN-OHL-S is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in\r\nunmodified form only.\r\n\r\nUse of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any Licensor or\r\ntheir designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in their development.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Definitions\r\n\r\n  1.1 'Licence' means this CERN-OHL-S.\r\n\r\n  1.2 'Compatible Licence' means\r\n\r\n       a) any earlier version of the CERN Open Hardware licence, or\r\n\r\n       b) any version of the CERN-OHL-S, or\r\n\r\n       c) any licence which permits You to treat the Source to which it\r\n          applies as licensed under CERN-OHL-S provided that on Conveyance of\r\n          any such Source, or any associated Product You treat the Source in\r\n          question as being licensed under CERN-OHL-S.\r\n\r\n  1.3 'Source' means information such as design materials or digital code\r\n      which can be applied to Make or test a Product or to prepare a Product\r\n      for use, Conveyance or sale, regardless of its medium or how it is\r\n      expressed. It may include Notices.\r\n\r\n  1.4 'Covered Source' means Source that is explicitly made available under\r\n      this Licence.\r\n\r\n  1.5 'Product' means any device, component, work or physical object, whether\r\n      in finished or intermediate form, arising from the use, application or\r\n      processing of Covered Source.\r\n\r\n  1.6 'Make' means to create or configure something, whether by manufacture,\r\n      assembly, compiling, loading or applying Covered Source or another\r\n      Product or otherwise.\r\n\r\n  1.7 'Available Component' means any part, sub-assembly, library or code\r\n      which:\r\n\r\n       a) is licensed to You as Complete Source under a Compatible Licence; or\r\n\r\n       b) is available, at the time a Product or the Source containing it is\r\n          first Conveyed, to You and any other prospective licensees\r\n\r\n            i) as a physical part with sufficient rights and information\r\n               (including any configuration and programming files and\r\n               information about its characteristics and interfaces) to enable\r\n               it either to be Made itself, or to be sourced and used to Make\r\n               the Product; or\r\n           ii) as part of the normal distribution of a tool used to design or\r\n               Make the Product.\r\n\r\n  1.8 'Complete Source' means the set of all Source necessary to Make a\r\n      Product, in the preferred form for making modifications, including\r\n      necessary installation and interfacing information both for the Product,\r\n      and for any included Available Components.  If the format is\r\n      proprietary, it must also be made available in a format (if the\r\n      proprietary tool can create it) which is viewable with a tool available\r\n      to potential licensees and licensed under a licence approved by the Free\r\n      Software Foundation or the Open Source Initiative. Complete Source need\r\n      not include the Source of any Available Component, provided that You\r\n      include in the Complete Source sufficient information to enable a\r\n      recipient to Make or source and use the Available Component to Make the\r\n      Product.\r\n\r\n  1.9 'Source Location' means a location where a Licensor has placed Covered\r\n      Source, and which that Licensor reasonably believes will remain easily\r\n      accessible for at least three years for anyone to obtain a digital copy.\r\n\r\n 1.10 'Notice' means copyright, acknowledgement and trademark notices, Source\r\n      Location references, modification notices (subsection 3.3(b)) and all\r\n      notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties\r\n      that are included in the Covered Source.\r\n\r\n 1.11 'Licensee' or 'You' means any person exercising rights under this\r\n      Licence.\r\n\r\n 1.12 'Licensor' means a natural or legal person who creates or modifies\r\n      Covered Source. A person may be a Licensee and a Licensor at the same\r\n      time.\r\n\r\n 1.13 'Convey' means to communicate to the public or distribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Applicability\r\n\r\n  2.1 This Licence governs the use, copying, modification, Conveying of\r\n      Covered Source and Products, and the Making of Products. By exercising\r\n      any right granted under this Licence, You irrevocably accept these terms\r\n      and conditions.\r\n\r\n  2.2 This Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to You, and shall apply\r\n      worldwide and without limitation in time.\r\n\r\n  2.3 You shall not attempt to restrict by contract or otherwise the rights\r\n      granted under this Licence to other Licensees.\r\n\r\n  2.4 This Licence is not intended to restrict fair use, fair dealing, or any\r\n      other similar right.\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Copying, Modifying and Conveying Covered Source\r\n\r\n  3.1 You may copy and Convey verbatim copies of Covered Source, in any\r\n      medium, provided You retain all Notices.\r\n\r\n  3.2 You may modify Covered Source, other than Notices, provided that You\r\n      irrevocably undertake to make that modified Covered Source available\r\n      from a Source Location should You Convey a Product in circumstances\r\n      where the recipient does not otherwise receive a copy of the modified\r\n      Covered Source. In each case subsection 3.3 shall apply.\r\n\r\n      You may only delete Notices if they are no longer applicable to the\r\n      corresponding Covered Source as modified by You and You may add\r\n      additional Notices applicable to Your modifications.  Including Covered\r\n      Source in a larger work is modifying the Covered Source, and the larger\r\n      work becomes modified Covered Source.\r\n\r\n  3.3 You may Convey modified Covered Source (with the effect that You shall\r\n      also become a Licensor) provided that You:\r\n\r\n       a) retain Notices as required in subsection 3.2;\r\n\r\n       b) add a Notice to the modified Covered Source stating that You have\r\n          modified it, with the date and brief description of how You have\r\n          modified it;\r\n\r\n       c) add a Source Location Notice for the modified Covered Source if You\r\n          Convey in circumstances where the recipient does not otherwise\r\n          receive a copy of the modified Covered Source; and\r\n\r\n       d) license the modified Covered Source under the terms and conditions\r\n          of this Licence (or, as set out in subsection 8.3, a later version,\r\n          if permitted by the licence of the original Covered Source). Such\r\n          modified Covered Source must be licensed as a whole, but excluding\r\n          Available Components contained in it, which remain licensed under\r\n          their own applicable licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Making and Conveying Products\r\n\r\nYou may Make Products, and/or Convey them, provided that You either provide\r\neach recipient with a copy of the Complete Source or ensure that each\r\nrecipient is notified of the Source Location of the Complete Source. That\r\nComplete Source is Covered Source, and You must accordingly satisfy Your\r\nobligations set out in subsection 3.3. If specified in a Notice, the Product\r\nmust visibly and securely display the Source Location on it or its packaging\r\nor documentation in the manner specified in that Notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Research and Development\r\n\r\nYou may Convey Covered Source, modified Covered Source or Products to a legal\r\nentity carrying out development, testing or quality assurance work on Your\r\nbehalf provided that the work is performed on terms which prevent the entity\r\nfrom both using the Source or Products for its own internal purposes and\r\nConveying the Source or Products or any modifications to them to any person\r\nother than You. Any modifications made by the entity shall be deemed to be\r\nmade by You pursuant to subsection 3.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n6 DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY\r\n\r\n  6.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY -- The Covered Source and any Products are\r\n      provided 'as is' and any express or implied warranties, including, but\r\n      not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, of satisfactory\r\n      quality, non-infringement of third party rights, and fitness for a\r\n      particular purpose or use are disclaimed in respect of any Source or\r\n      Product to the maximum extent permitted by law. The Licensor makes no\r\n      representation that any Source or Product does not or will not infringe\r\n      any patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right. The\r\n      entire risk as to the use, quality, and performance of any Source or\r\n      Product shall be with You and not the Licensor. This disclaimer of\r\n      warranty is an essential part of this Licence and a condition for the\r\n      grant of any rights granted under this Licence.\r\n\r\n  6.2 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY -- The Licensor shall, to the\r\n      maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability for direct, indirect,\r\n      special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive or other damages\r\n      of any character including, without limitation, procurement of\r\n      substitute goods or services, loss of use, data or profits, or business\r\n      interruption, however caused and on any theory of contract, warranty,\r\n      tort (including negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in\r\n      any way in relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered Source\r\n      and/or the Making or Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of the\r\n      possibility of such damages, and You shall hold the Licensor(s) free and\r\n      harmless from any liability, costs, damages, fees and expenses,\r\n      including claims by third parties, in relation to such use.\r\n\r\n\r\n7 Patents\r\n\r\n  7.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each Licensor\r\n      hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,\r\n      royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in subsections 7.2 and 8.4)\r\n      patent licence to Make, have Made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and\r\n      otherwise transfer the Covered Source and Products, where such licence\r\n      applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Licensor that are\r\n      necessarily infringed by exercising rights under the Covered Source as\r\n      Conveyed by that Licensor.\r\n\r\n  7.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\r\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Covered\r\n      Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory patent\r\n      infringement, or You seek any declaration that a patent licensed to You\r\n      under this Licence is invalid or unenforceable then any rights granted\r\n      to You under this Licence shall terminate as of the date such process is\r\n      initiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n8 General\r\n\r\n  8.1 If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become invalid or\r\n      unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall remain\r\n      effective.\r\n\r\n  8.2 You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and\r\n      abbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor or CERN is known,\r\n      except where needed to comply with section 3, or where the use is\r\n      otherwise allowed by law. Any such permitted use shall be factual and\r\n      shall not be made so as to suggest any kind of endorsement or\r\n      implication of involvement by the Licensor or its personnel.\r\n\r\n  8.3 CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence which it\r\n      considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may differ in detail\r\n      to address new problems or concerns. New versions will be published with\r\n      a unique version number and a variant identifier specifying the variant.\r\n      If the Licensor has specified that a given variant applies to the\r\n      Covered Source without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered\r\n      Source as being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that\r\n      variant. If no variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be treated\r\n      as being released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor may also specify that\r\n      the Covered Source is subject to a specific version of the CERN-OHL or\r\n      any later version in which case You may apply this or any later version\r\n      of CERN-OHL with the same variant identifier published by CERN.\r\n\r\n  8.4 This Licence shall terminate with immediate effect if You fail to comply\r\n      with any of its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n  8.5 However, if You cease all breaches of this Licence, then Your Licence\r\n      from any Licensor is reinstated unless such Licensor has terminated this\r\n      Licence by giving You, while You remain in breach, a notice specifying\r\n      the breach and requiring You to cure it within 30 days, and You have\r\n      failed to come into compliance in all material respects by the end of\r\n      the 30 day period. Should You repeat the breach after receipt of a cure\r\n      notice and subsequent reinstatement, this Licence will terminate\r\n      immediately and permanently. Section 6 shall continue to apply after any\r\n      termination.\r\n\r\n  8.6 This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor acting as\r\n      such, and third party beneficiary rights are specifically excluded."

That Complete Source includes Covered Source and You must\r\n      accordingly satisfy Your obligations set out in subsection 3.3. If\r\n      specified in a Notice, the Product must visibly and securely display the\r\n      Source Location on it or its packaging or documentation in the manner\r\n      specified in that Notice.\r\n\r\n  4.2 Where You Convey a Product which incorporates External Material, the\r\n      Complete Source for that Product which You are required to provide under\r\n      subsection 4.1 need not include any Source for the External Material.\r\n\r\n  4.3 You may license Products under terms of Your choice, provided that such\r\n      terms do not restrict or attempt to restrict any recipients' rights\r\n      under this Licence to the Covered Source.\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Research and Development\r\n\r\nYou may Convey Covered Source, modified Covered Source or Products to a legal\r\nentity carrying out development, testing or quality assurance work on Your\r\nbehalf provided that the work is performed on terms which prevent the entity\r\nfrom both using the Source or Products for its own internal purposes and\r\nConveying the Source or Products or any modifications to them to any person\r\nother than You. Any modifications made by the entity shall be deemed to be\r\nmade by You pursuant to subsection 3.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n6 DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY\r\n\r\n  6.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY -- The Covered Source and any Products are\r\n      provided 'as is' and any express or implied warranties, including, but\r\n      not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, of satisfactory\r\n      quality, non-infringement of third party rights, and fitness for a\r\n      particular purpose or use are disclaimed in respect of any Source or\r\n      Product to the maximum extent permitted by law. The Licensor makes no\r\n      representation that any Source or Product does not or will not infringe\r\n      any patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right. The\r\n      entire risk as to the use, quality, and performance of any Source or\r\n      Product shall be with You and not the Licensor. This disclaimer of\r\n      warranty is an essential part of this Licence and a condition for the\r\n      grant of any rights granted under this Licence.\r\n\r\n  6.2 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY -- The Licensor shall, to the\r\n      maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability for direct, indirect,\r\n      special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive or other damages\r\n      of any character including, without limitation, procurement of\r\n      substitute goods or services, loss of use, data or profits, or business\r\n      interruption, however caused and on any theory of contract, warranty,\r\n      tort (including negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in\r\n      any way in relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered Source\r\n      and/or the Making or Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of the\r\n      possibility of such damages, and You shall hold the Licensor(s) free and\r\n      harmless from any liability, costs, damages, fees and expenses,\r\n      including claims by third parties, in relation to such use.\r\n\r\n\r\n7 Patents\r\n\r\n  7.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each Licensor\r\n      hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,\r\n      royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in subsections 7.2 and 8.4)\r\n      patent licence to Make, have Made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and\r\n      otherwise transfer the Covered Source and Products, where such licence\r\n      applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Licensor that are\r\n      necessarily infringed by exercising rights under the Covered Source as\r\n      Conveyed by that Licensor.\r\n\r\n  7.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\r\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Covered\r\n      Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory patent\r\n      infringement, or You seek any declaration that a patent licensed to You\r\n      under this Licence is invalid or unenforceable then any rights granted\r\n      to You under this Licence shall terminate as of the date such process is\r\n      initiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n8 General\r\n\r\n  8.1 If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become invalid or\r\n      unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall remain\r\n      effective.\r\n\r\n  8.2 You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and\r\n      abbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor or CERN is known,\r\n      except where needed to comply with section 3, or where the use is\r\n      otherwise allowed by law. Any such permitted use shall be factual and\r\n      shall not be made so as to suggest any kind of endorsement or\r\n      implication of involvement by the Licensor or its personnel.\r\n\r\n  8.3 CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence which it\r\n      considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may differ in detail\r\n      to address new problems or concerns. New versions will be published with\r\n      a unique version number and a variant identifier specifying the variant.\r\n      If the Licensor has specified that a given variant applies to the\r\n      Covered Source without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered\r\n      Source as being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that\r\n      variant. If no variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be treated\r\n      as being released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor may also specify that\r\n      the Covered Source is subject to a specific version of the CERN-OHL or\r\n      any later version in which case You may apply this or any later version\r\n      of CERN-OHL with the same variant identifier published by CERN.\r\n\r\n      You may treat Covered Source licensed under CERN-OHL-W as licensed under\r\n      CERN-OHL-S if and only if all Available Components referenced in the\r\n      Covered Source comply with the corresponding definition of Available\r\n      Component for CERN-OHL-S.\r\n\r\n  8.4 This Licence shall terminate with immediate effect if You fail to comply\r\n      with any of its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n  8.5 However, if You cease all breaches of this Licence, then Your Licence\r\n      from any Licensor is reinstated unless such Licensor has terminated this\r\n      Licence by giving You, while You remain in breach, a notice specifying\r\n      the breach and requiring You to cure it within 30 days, and You have\r\n      failed to come into compliance in all material respects by the end of\r\n      the 30 day period. Should You repeat the breach after receipt of a cure\r\n      notice and subsequent reinstatement, this Licence will terminate\r\n      immediately and permanently. Section 6 shall continue to apply after any\r\n      termination.\r\n\r\n  8.6 This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor acting as\r\n       such, and third party beneficiary rights are specifically excluded."

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\r\nCONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\r\n\r\n1. DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n\"Contribution\" means:\r\n     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\r\n     documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\r\n     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\r\n          i) changes to the Program, and\r\n          ii) additions to the Program;\r\n\r\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\r\ndistributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a\r\nContributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or\r\nanyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include\r\nadditions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software\r\ndistributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,\r\nand (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\r\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\r\nnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\r\ncombined with the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\r\nAgreement.\r\n\r\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\r\nincluding all Contributors.\r\n\r\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\n     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\r\n     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\r\n     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\r\n     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,\r\n     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\r\n\r\n     b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\r\n     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\r\n     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\r\n     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\r\n     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of\r\n     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is\r\n     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\r\n     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license\r\n     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.\r\n     No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\r\n\r\n     c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\r\n     licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\r\n     provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent\r\n     or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\r\n     Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\r\n     any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or\r\n     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted\r\n     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure\r\n     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\r\n     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute\r\n     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\r\n     before distributing the Program.\r\n\r\n     d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\r\n     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\r\n     license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n\r\n3. REQUIREMENTS\r\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\r\nits own license agreement, provided that:\r\n\r\n     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\r\n\r\n     b) its license agreement:\r\n          i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\r\n          warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties\r\n          or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties\r\n          or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular\r\n          purpose;\r\n          ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability\r\n          for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\r\n          consequential damages, such as lost profits;\r\n          iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\r\n          offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\r\n          iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\r\n          Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\r\n          manner on or through a medium customarily used for software\r\n          exchange.\r\n\r\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\r\n\r\n     a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\r\n\r\n     b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the\r\n     Program.\r\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within\r\nthe Program.\r\n\r\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,\r\nif any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify\r\nthe originator of the Contribution.\r\n\r\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\r\nrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\r\nintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\r\nincludes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\r\nwhich does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,\r\nif a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\r\nContributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\r\nevery other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\r\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and\r\nother legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\r\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial\r\nContributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\r\nproduct offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims\r\nor Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\r\ninfringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\r\npromptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)\r\nallow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial\r\nContributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The\r\nIndemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\r\noffering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If\r\nthat Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\r\nwarranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are\r\nsuch Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\r\nCommercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\r\nContributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\r\ncourt requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\r\nCommercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n\r\n5. NO WARRANTY\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\r\n\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\r\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\r\nRecipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\r\nand distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\r\nexercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the\r\nrisks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to\r\nor loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\r\nCONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\r\nSPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\r\nLOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\r\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\r\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\r\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\r\nOF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. GENERAL\r\n\r\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\r\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\r\nremainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\r\nparties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\r\nnecessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\r\ncross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\r\n(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\r\ninfringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\r\nunder Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\r\ncomply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\r\nnot cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\r\nsuch noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\r\nRecipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\r\nreasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\r\nand any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\r\nand survive.\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\r\norder to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\r\nmodified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\r\npublish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to\r\ntime. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this\r\nAgreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The\r\nEclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement\r\nSteward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will\r\nbe given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\r\nContributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\r\nAgreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\r\nAgreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\r\n(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\r\nstated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\r\nlicenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\r\nwhether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.

GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\n  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\r\n  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\r\n  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\r\n  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\r\n  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\r\n\r\n  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\r\n  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\r\n  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\r\n  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\r\n  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\r\n  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\r\n  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\r\n  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\r\n  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\r\n  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\r\n  licensed hereunder.\r\n\r\n  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\r\n  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\r\n  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\r\n  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\r\n  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\r\n  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\r\n  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\r\n  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\r\n  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\r\n  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\r\n  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\r\n  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\r\n  before distributing the Program.\r\n\r\n  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\r\n  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\r\n  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n\r\n  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\r\n  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\r\n  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\r\n  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\r\n  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\r\n\r\n3. REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\r\n\r\n  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\r\n  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\r\n  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\r\n  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\r\n  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\r\n  used for software exchange; and\r\n\r\n  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\r\n  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\r\n     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\r\n     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\r\n     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\r\n     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\r\n     for a particular purpose;\r\n\r\n     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\r\n     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\r\n     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\r\n\r\n     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\r\n     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\r\n\r\n     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\r\n     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\r\n     of this section 3.\r\n\r\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\r\n\r\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\r\n  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\r\n  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\r\n  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\r\n  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\r\n  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\r\n\r\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\r\n  the Program.\r\n\r\n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\r\ntrademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\r\nof liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\r\nthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\r\ntheir own appropriate notices.\r\n\r\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\r\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\r\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\r\nthe Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\r\noffering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\r\nliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\r\nthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\r\n(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\r\nother Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\r\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\r\nand other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\r\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\r\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\r\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\r\napply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\r\nintellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\r\nContributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\r\nwriting of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\r\nand cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\r\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\r\nparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\r\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\r\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\r\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\r\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\r\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\r\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\r\nclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\r\npay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\r\nthose damages.\r\n\r\n5. NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\r\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\r\nBASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\r\nTITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\nPURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\r\nappropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\r\nrisks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\r\nincluding but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\r\ncompliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\r\nor equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\r\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\r\nSHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\r\nEXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\r\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\r\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\r\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\r\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. GENERAL\r\n\r\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\r\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\r\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\r\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\r\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\r\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\r\nProgram itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\r\nor hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\r\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\r\nlitigation is filed.\r\n\r\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\r\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\r\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\r\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\r\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\r\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\r\nHowever, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\r\ngranted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\r\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\r\nmay only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\r\nreserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\r\nthis Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\r\nSteward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\r\nis the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\r\nresponsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\r\nentity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\r\nversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\r\nDistributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\r\nreceived. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\r\nContributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\r\nContributions) under the new version.\r\n\r\nExcept as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\r\nreceives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\r\nContributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\r\nestoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\r\nunder this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\r\nto be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\r\nNo third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\r\n\r\nExhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\r\n\r\n\"This Source Code may also be made available under the following\r\nSecondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth\r\nin the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),\r\nversion(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.\"\r\n\r\n  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A\r\n  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\r\n\r\n  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\r\n  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\r\n  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\r\n  look for such a notice.\r\n\r\n  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership."

However, in\r\naccepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your\r\nsole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other\r\nContributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each\r\nContributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against\r\nsuch Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional\r\nliability.\r\n\r\n\r\n10.

Any use of\r\nthe Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the\r\nextent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).\r\n\r\nThe Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as\r\ndefined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the\r\ncopyright notice for the Work:\r\n\r\n        Licensed under the EUPL\r\n\r\nor has expressed by any other means his willingness to license under the EUPL.\r\n\r\n1. Definitions\r\n\r\nIn this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:\r\n\r\n- ‘The Licence’: this Licence.\r\n\r\n- ‘The Original Work’: the work or software distributed or communicated by the\r\n  Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable\r\n  Code as the case may be.\r\n\r\n- ‘Derivative Works’: the works or software that could be created by the\r\n  Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This\r\n  Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the\r\n  Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work;\r\n  this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country\r\n  mentioned in Article 15.\r\n\r\n- ‘The Work’: the Original Work or its Derivative Works.\r\n\r\n- ‘The Source Code’: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most\r\n  convenient for people to study and modify.\r\n\r\n- ‘The Executable Code’: any code which has generally been compiled and which\r\n  is meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.\r\n\r\n- ‘The Licensor’: the natural or legal person that distributes or communicates\r\n  the Work under the Licence.\r\n\r\n- ‘Contributor(s)’: any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under\r\n  the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.\r\n\r\n- ‘The Licensee’ or ‘You’: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of\r\n  the Work under the terms of the Licence.\r\n\r\n- ‘Distribution’ or ‘Communication’: any act of selling, giving, lending,\r\n  renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making\r\n  available, online or offline, copies of the Work or providing access to its\r\n  essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal\r\n  person.\r\n\r\n2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence\r\n\r\nThe Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\r\nsublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright\r\nvested in the Original Work:\r\n\r\n- use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,\r\n- reproduce the Work,\r\n- modify the Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,\r\n- communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display\r\n  the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case\r\n  may be, the Work,\r\n- distribute the Work or copies thereof,\r\n- lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,\r\n- sublicense rights in the Work or copies thereof.\r\n\r\nThose rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now\r\nknown or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.\r\n\r\nIn the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to\r\nexercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make\r\neffective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.\r\n\r\nThe Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non-exclusive usage rights\r\nto any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of\r\nthe rights granted on the Work under this Licence.\r\n\r\n3. Communication of the Source Code\r\n\r\nThe Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as\r\nExecutable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor\r\nprovides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work\r\nalong with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates,\r\nin a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository\r\nwhere the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the\r\nLicensor continues to distribute or communicate the Work.\r\n\r\n4. Limitations on copyright\r\n\r\nNothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits\r\nfrom any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners\r\nin the Work, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable\r\nlimitations thereto.\r\n\r\n5. Obligations of the Licensee\r\n\r\nThe grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and\r\nobligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:\r\n\r\nAttribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or\r\ntrademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the\r\ndisclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and\r\na copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes or\r\ncommunicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent\r\nnotices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.\r\n\r\nCopyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the\r\nOriginal Works or Derivative Works, this Distribution or Communication will be\r\ndone under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence\r\nunless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of\r\nthe Licence — for example by communicating ‘EUPL v. 1.2 only’. The Licensee\r\n(becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions\r\non the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the\r\nLicence.\r\n\r\nCompatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative\r\nWorks or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another work licensed\r\nunder a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done\r\nunder the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause,\r\n‘Compatible Licence’ refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to\r\nthis Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence\r\nconflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the\r\nCompatible Licence shall prevail.\r\n\r\nProvision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the\r\nWork, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or\r\nindicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available\r\nfor as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.\r\n\r\nLegal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade\r\nnames, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required\r\nfor reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and\r\nreproducing the content of the copyright notice.\r\n\r\n6. Chain of Authorship\r\n\r\nThe original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted\r\nhereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the\r\npower and authority to grant the Licence.\r\n\r\nEach Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she\r\nbrings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she\r\nhas the power and authority to grant the Licence.\r\n\r\nEach time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent\r\nContributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the\r\nterms of this Licence.\r\n\r\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty\r\n\r\nThe Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous\r\nContributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or\r\n‘bugs’ inherent to this type of development.\r\n\r\nFor the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an ‘as is’\r\nbasis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including\r\nwithout limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence\r\nof defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property\r\nrights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.\r\n\r\nThis disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a\r\ncondition for the grant of any rights to the Work.\r\n\r\n8. Disclaimer of Liability\r\n\r\nExcept in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural\r\npersons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect,\r\nmaterial or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the\r\nuse of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,\r\nwork stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial\r\ndamage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such\r\ndamage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability\r\nlaws as far such laws apply to the Work.\r\n\r\n9. Additional agreements\r\n\r\nWhile distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional\r\nagreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence.\r\nHowever, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on\r\nyour sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other\r\nContributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each\r\nContributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against\r\nsuch Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional\r\nliability.\r\n\r\n10. Acceptance of the Licence\r\n\r\nThe provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ‘I\r\nagree’ placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence\r\nor by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules\r\nof applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable\r\nacceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and\r\nconditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this\r\nLicence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work\r\nor the Distribution or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.\r\n\r\n11. Information to the public\r\n\r\nIn case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of\r\nelectronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work\r\nfrom a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a\r\nwebsite) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the\r\napplicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be\r\naccessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.\r\n\r\n12. Termination of the Licence\r\n\r\nThe Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon\r\nany breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.\r\n\r\nSuch a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has\r\nreceived the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons\r\nremain in full compliance with the Licence.\r\n\r\n13. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nWithout prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete\r\nagreement between the Parties as to the Work.\r\n\r\nIf any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\r\nlaw, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a\r\nwhole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it\r\nvalid and enforceable.\r\n\r\nThe European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions\r\nof this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is required\r\nand reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the\r\nLicence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nAll linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission,\r\nhave identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of\r\ntheir choice.\r\n\r\n14. Jurisdiction\r\n\r\nWithout prejudice to specific agreement between parties,\r\n\r\n- any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising\r\n  between the European Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, as a\r\n  Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court\r\n  of Justice of the European Union, as laid down in article 272 of the Treaty\r\n  on the Functioning of the European Union,\r\n\r\n- any litigation arising between other parties and resulting from the\r\n  interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive\r\n  jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts\r\n  its primary business.\r\n\r\n15.

PREAMBLE\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\r\nfunctional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to\r\nassure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\r\nwith or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\r\nSecondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\r\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible\r\nfor modifications made by others.\r\n\r\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative\r\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\r\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\r\nlicense designed for free software.\r\n\r\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\r\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\r\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\r\nsoftware does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\r\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\r\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\r\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\r\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\r\ndistributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\r\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\r\nwork under the conditions stated herein.  The \"Document\", below,\r\nrefers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\r\nlicensee, and is addressed as \"you\".  You accept the license if you\r\ncopy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\r\nunder copyright law.\r\n\r\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the\r\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\r\nmodifications and/or translated into another language.\r\n\r\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\r\nthe Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\r\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall\r\nsubject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall\r\ndirectly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in\r\npart a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain\r\nany mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\r\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\r\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\r\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\r\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\r\nsection does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\r\nallowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero\r\nInvariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\r\nSections then there are none.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed,\r\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\r\nthe Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\r\nbe at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\r\n\r\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\r\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the\r\ngeneral public, that is suitable for revising the document\r\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\r\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\r\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\r\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\r\nto text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\r\nformat whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\r\nor discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\r\nAn image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\r\nof text.  A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\r\n\r\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\r\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\r\nor XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\r\nHTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\r\ntransparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats\r\ninclude proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\r\nproprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or\r\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the\r\nmachine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word\r\nprocessors for output purposes only.\r\n\r\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\r\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\r\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\r\nformats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means\r\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\r\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\r\n\r\nThe \"publisher\" means any person or entity that distributes copies of\r\nthe Document to the public.\r\n\r\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose\r\ntitle either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\r\ntext that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\r\nspecific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\",\r\n\"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".)  To \"Preserve the Title\"\r\nof such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\r\nsection \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\r\n\r\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\r\nstates that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\r\nDisclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\r\nLicense, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\r\nimplication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\r\nno effect on the meaning of this License.\r\n\r\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\r\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\r\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\r\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no\r\nother conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\r\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\r\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\r\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\r\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\r\n\r\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\r\nyou may publicly display copies.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\r\n\r\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\r\nprinted covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\r\nDocument's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the\r\ncopies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\r\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\r\nthe back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\r\nyou as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\r\nthe full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\r\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\r\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\r\nthe title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\r\nas verbatim copying in other respects.\r\n\r\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\r\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\r\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\r\npages.\r\n\r\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\r\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\r\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\r\na computer-network location from which the general network-using\r\npublic has access to download using public-standard network protocols\r\na complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\r\nIf you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\r\nwhen you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\r\nthat this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\r\nlocation until at least one year after the last time you distribute an\r\nOpaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\r\nedition to the public.\r\n\r\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\r\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to\r\ngive them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the\r\nDocument.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. MODIFICATIONS\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\r\nthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\r\nthe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\r\nVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\r\nand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\r\nof it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\r\n\r\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\r\n   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\r\n   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\r\n   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\r\n   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\r\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\r\n   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\r\n   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\r\n   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),\r\n   unless they release you from this requirement.\r\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\r\n   Modified Version, as the publisher.\r\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\r\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\r\n   adjacent to the other copyright notices.\r\nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\r\n   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\r\n   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\r\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\r\n   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\r\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\r\nI. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add\r\n   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\r\n   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\r\n   there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one\r\n   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\r\n   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\r\n   Version as stated in the previous sentence.\r\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\r\n   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\r\n   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\r\n   it was based on.  These may be placed in the \"History\" section.\r\n   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\r\n   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\r\n   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\r\nK. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\",\r\n   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all\r\n   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\r\n   and/or dedications given therein.\r\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\r\n   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\r\n   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\r\nM. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\".  Such a section\r\n   may not be included in the Modified Version.\r\nN. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\"\r\n   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\r\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\r\n\r\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\r\nappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\r\ncopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\r\nof these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\r\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\r\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\r\n\r\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\r\nnothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\r\nparties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\r\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\r\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\r\nof Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\r\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\r\nthrough arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\r\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\r\nby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\r\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\r\npermission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\r\n\r\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\r\ngive permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\r\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\r\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\r\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\r\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\r\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\r\nlicense notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\r\n\r\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\r\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\r\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\r\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\r\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\r\nauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\r\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\r\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\r\n\r\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\"\r\nin the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\r\n\"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\r\nand any sections Entitled \"Dedications\".  You must delete all sections\r\nEntitled \"Endorsements\".\r\n\r\n\r\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other\r\ndocuments released under this License, and replace the individual\r\ncopies of this License in the various documents with a single copy\r\nthat is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules\r\nof this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all\r\nother respects.\r\n\r\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and\r\ndistribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a\r\ncopy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this\r\nLicense in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\r\n\r\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\r\nand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\r\ndistribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright\r\nresulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights\r\nof the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.\r\nWhen the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not\r\napply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\r\nderivative works of the Document.\r\n\r\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\r\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\r\nthe entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\r\ncovers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\r\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\r\nOtherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\r\naggregate.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. TRANSLATION\r\n\r\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\r\ndistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\r\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\r\npermission from their copyright holders, but you may include\r\ntranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\r\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\r\ntranslation of this License, and all the license notices in the\r\nDocument, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\r\nthe original English version of this License and the original versions\r\nof those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between\r\nthe translation and the original version of this License or a notice\r\nor disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\r\n\r\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\r\n\"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\r\nits Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. TERMINATION\r\n\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document\r\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and\r\nwill automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\r\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\r\nunless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\r\nterminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder\r\nfails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to\r\n60 days after the cessation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\r\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\r\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\r\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\r\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\r\nyour receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\r\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\r\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\r\nreinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does\r\nnot give you any rights to use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\r\n\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the\r\nGNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions\r\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\r\ndetail to address new problems or concerns.  See\r\nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\r\n\r\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\r\nIf the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\r\nLicense \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of\r\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\r\nof any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\r\nFree Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\r\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\r\nas a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document\r\nspecifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this\r\nLicense can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a\r\nversion permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the\r\nDocument.\r\n\r\n11. RELICENSING\r\n\r\n\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any\r\nWorld Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also\r\nprovides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A\r\npublic wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A\r\n\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site\r\nmeans any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\r\n\r\n\"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 \r\nlicense published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit \r\ncorporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, \r\nCalifornia, as well as future copyleft versions of that license \r\npublished by that same organization.\r\n\r\n\"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in \r\npart, as part of another Document.\r\n\r\nAn MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this \r\nLicense, and if all works that were first published under this License \r\nsomewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or \r\nin part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and \r\n(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\r\n\r\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site\r\nunder CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,\r\nprovided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\r\n\r\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\r\nthe License in the document and put the following copyright and\r\nlicense notices just after the title page:\r\n\r\n    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\r\n    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\r\n    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3\r\n    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\r\n    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\r\n    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU\r\n    Free Documentation License\".\r\n\r\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\r\nreplace the \"with...Texts.\" line with this:\r\n\r\n    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\r\n    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\r\n\r\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other\r\ncombination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\r\nrecommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of\r\nfree software license, such as the GNU General Public License,\r\nto permit their use in free software."

By contrast, the GNU General Public\r\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\r\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\r\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\r\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\r\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\r\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\r\nyour programs, too.\r\n\r\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\r\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\r\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\r\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\r\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\r\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\r\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\r\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\r\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\r\n\r\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\r\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\r\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\r\nauthors' reputations.\r\n\r\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\r\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\r\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\r\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\r\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\r\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\r\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\r\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\r\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\r\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\r\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\r\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\r\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\r\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\r\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\r\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\r\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\r\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\r\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\r\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\r\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\r\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\r\nalong with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\r\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\r\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\r\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n\r\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\r\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\r\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\r\n    parties under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\r\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\r\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\r\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\r\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\r\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\r\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\r\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\r\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\r\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\r\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\ncollective works based on the Program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\r\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\r\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\nthe scope of this License.\r\n\r\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\r\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\r\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\r\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\r\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\r\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\r\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\r\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\r\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\r\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\n\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\r\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\r\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\r\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\r\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\r\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\r\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\r\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\r\nitself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\r\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\r\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\r\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\r\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\r\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\r\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\r\nparties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Program or works based on it.\r\n\r\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\r\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\r\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\r\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\r\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\r\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\r\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\nimpose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\r\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\r\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\r\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\r\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\r\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\r\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\r\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\r\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.\r\n\r\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\r\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\r\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\r\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\r\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\n                            NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\r\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\r\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\r\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\r\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\r\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\r\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\r\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\r\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\r\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\r\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\r\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\r\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\r\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\r\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\r\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\r\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\r\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\r\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\r\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\r\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\r\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\r\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\r\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\r\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\r\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\r\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\r\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\r\n\r\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\r\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\r\n\r\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\r\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\r\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\r\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\r\nPublic License instead of this License."

By contrast,\r\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\r\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\r\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\r\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\r\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\r\nyour programs, too.\r\n\r\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\r\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\r\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\r\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\r\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\r\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\r\n\r\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\r\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\r\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\r\nknow their rights.\r\n\r\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\r\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\r\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\r\n\r\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\r\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\r\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\r\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\r\nauthors of previous versions.\r\n\r\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\r\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\r\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\r\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\r\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\r\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\r\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\r\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\r\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\r\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\r\n\r\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\r\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\r\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\r\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\r\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\r\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\r\n\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\r\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n  0. Definitions.\r\n\r\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\r\n\r\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\r\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\r\n\r\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\r\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\r\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\r\n\r\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\r\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\r\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\r\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\r\n\r\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\r\non the Program.\r\n\r\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\r\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\r\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\r\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\r\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\r\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\r\n\r\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\r\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\r\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\r\n\r\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\r\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\r\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\r\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\r\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\r\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\r\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\r\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\r\n\r\n  1. Source Code.\r\n\r\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\r\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\r\nform of a work.\r\n\r\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\r\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\r\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\r\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\r\n\r\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\r\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\r\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\r\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\r\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\r\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\r\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\r\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\r\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\r\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\r\n\r\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\r\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\r\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\r\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\r\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\r\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\r\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\r\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\r\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\r\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\r\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\r\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\r\n\r\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\r\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\r\nSource.\r\n\r\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\r\nsame work.\r\n\r\n  2. Basic Permissions.\r\n\r\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\r\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\r\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\r\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\r\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\r\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\r\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\r\n\r\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\r\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\r\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\r\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\r\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\r\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\r\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\r\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\r\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\r\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\r\n\r\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\r\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\r\nmakes it unnecessary.\r\n\r\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\r\n\r\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\r\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\r\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\r\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\r\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\r\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\r\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\r\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\r\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\r\ntechnological measures.\r\n\r\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\r\n\r\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\r\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\r\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\r\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\r\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\r\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\r\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\r\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\r\n\r\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\r\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\r\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\r\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\r\n\r\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\r\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\r\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\r\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\r\n\r\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\r\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\r\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\r\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\r\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\r\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\r\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\r\n\r\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\r\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\r\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\r\n    work need not make them do so.\r\n\r\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\r\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\r\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\r\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\r\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\r\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\r\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\r\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\r\nparts of the aggregate.\r\n\r\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\r\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\r\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\r\nin one of these ways:\r\n\r\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\r\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\r\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\r\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\r\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\r\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\r\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\r\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\r\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\r\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\r\n\r\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\r\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\r\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\r\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\r\n    with subsection 6b.\r\n\r\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\r\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\r\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\r\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\r\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\r\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\r\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\r\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\r\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\r\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\r\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\r\n\r\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\r\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\r\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\r\n    charge under subsection 6d.\r\n\r\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\r\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\r\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\r\n\r\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\r\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\r\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\r\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\r\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\r\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\r\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\r\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\r\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\r\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\r\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\r\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\r\n\r\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\r\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\r\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\r\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\r\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\r\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\r\nmodification has been made.\r\n\r\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\r\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\r\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\r\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\r\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\r\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\r\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\r\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\r\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\r\nbeen installed in ROM).\r\n\r\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\r\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\r\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\r\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\r\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\r\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\r\nprotocols for communication across the network.\r\n\r\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\r\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\r\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\r\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\r\nunpacking, reading or copying.\r\n\r\n  7. Additional Terms.\r\n\r\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\r\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\r\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\r\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\r\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\r\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\r\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\r\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\r\n\r\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\r\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\r\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\r\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\r\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\r\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\r\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\r\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\r\n\r\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\r\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\r\n\r\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\r\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\r\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\r\n\r\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\r\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\r\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\r\n\r\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\r\n    authors of the material; or\r\n\r\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\r\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\r\n\r\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\r\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\r\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\r\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\r\n    those licensors and authors.\r\n\r\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\r\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\r\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\r\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\r\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\r\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\r\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\r\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\r\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\r\n\r\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\r\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\r\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\r\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\r\n\r\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\r\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\r\nthe above requirements apply either way.\r\n\r\n  8. Termination.\r\n\r\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\r\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\r\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\r\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\r\nparagraph of section 11).\r\n\r\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\r\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\r\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\r\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\r\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\r\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\r\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\r\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\r\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\r\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\r\nyour receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\r\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\r\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\r\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\r\nmaterial under section 10.\r\n\r\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\r\n\r\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\r\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\r\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\r\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\r\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\r\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\r\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\r\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\r\n\r\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\r\n\r\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\r\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\r\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\r\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\r\n\r\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\r\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\r\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\r\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\r\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\r\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\r\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\r\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\r\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\r\n\r\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\r\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\r\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\r\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\r\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\r\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\r\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\r\n\r\n  11. Patents.\r\n\r\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\r\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\r\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\r\n\r\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\r\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\r\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\r\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\r\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\r\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\r\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\r\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\r\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\r\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\r\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\r\n\r\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\r\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\r\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\r\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\r\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\r\npatent against the party.\r\n\r\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\r\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\r\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\r\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\r\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\r\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\r\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\r\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\r\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\r\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\r\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\r\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\r\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\r\n\r\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\r\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\r\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\r\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\r\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\r\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\r\nwork and works based on it.\r\n\r\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\r\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\r\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\r\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\r\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\r\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\r\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\r\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\r\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\r\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\r\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\r\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\r\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\r\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\r\n\r\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\r\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\r\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\r\n\r\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\r\n\r\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\r\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\r\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\r\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\r\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\r\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\r\n\r\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\r\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\r\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\r\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\r\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\r\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\r\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\r\ncombination as such.\r\n\r\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\r\n\r\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\r\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\r\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\r\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\r\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\r\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\r\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\r\nby the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\r\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\r\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\r\nto choose that version for the Program.\r\n\r\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\r\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\r\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\r\nlater version.\r\n\r\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\r\n\r\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\r\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\r\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\r\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\r\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\r\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\r\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\r\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\r\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\r\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\r\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\r\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\r\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\r\nSUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\r\n\r\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\r\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\r\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\r\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\r\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\r\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\r\n\r\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\r\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\r\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\r\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\r\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\r\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\r\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\r\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\r\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\r\n\r\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\r\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\r\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\r\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\r\n\r\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\r\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\r\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\r\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\r\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\r\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>."

It also counts\r\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\r\n the version number 2.1.]\r\n\r\n                            Preamble\r\n\r\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\r\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\r\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\r\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\r\n\r\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\r\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\r\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\r\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\r\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\r\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\r\n\r\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\r\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\r\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\r\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\r\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\r\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\r\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\r\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\r\n\r\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\r\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\r\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\r\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\r\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\r\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\r\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\r\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\r\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\r\n\r\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\r\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\r\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\r\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\r\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\r\nintroduced by others.\r\n\r\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\r\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\r\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\r\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\r\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\r\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\r\n\r\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\r\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\r\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\r\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\r\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\r\nlibraries into non-free programs.\r\n\r\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\r\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\r\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\r\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\r\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\r\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\r\nthe library.\r\n\r\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\r\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\r\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\r\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\r\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\r\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\r\nspecial circumstances.\r\n\r\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\r\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\r\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\r\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\r\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\r\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\r\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\r\n\r\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\r\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\r\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\r\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\r\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\r\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\r\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\r\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\r\n\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\r\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\r\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\r\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\r\n\r\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\r\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\r\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\r\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\r\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\r\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\r\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n\r\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\r\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\r\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\r\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\r\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\r\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\r\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\r\n\r\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\r\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\r\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\r\nand installation of the library.\r\n\r\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\r\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\r\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\r\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\r\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\r\n\r\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\r\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\r\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\r\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\r\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\r\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\r\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\r\nfee.\r\n\r\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\r\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\r\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\n\r\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\r\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n\r\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\r\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\r\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\r\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\r\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\r\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\r\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\r\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n\r\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\r\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\r\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\r\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\r\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\r\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\r\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\ncollective works based on the Library.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\r\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\r\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\nthe scope of this License.\r\n\r\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\r\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\r\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\r\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\r\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\r\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\r\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\r\nthese notices.\r\n\r\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\r\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\r\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n\r\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\r\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\r\n\r\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\r\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\r\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\r\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\r\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\r\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\r\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\r\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\r\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\r\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\r\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\r\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\r\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\r\n\r\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\r\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\r\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\r\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\r\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\r\n\r\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\r\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\r\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\r\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\r\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\r\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n\r\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\r\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\r\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\r\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\r\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\r\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\r\n\r\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\r\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\r\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\r\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\r\n\r\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\r\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\r\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\r\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\r\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\r\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\r\n\r\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\r\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\r\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\r\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\r\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\r\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\r\nof these things:\r\n\r\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\r\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\r\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\r\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\r\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\r\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\r\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\r\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\r\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\r\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\r\n    to use the modified definitions.)\r\n\r\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\r\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\r\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\r\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\r\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\r\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\r\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\r\n\r\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\r\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\r\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\r\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\r\n\r\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\r\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\r\n    specified materials from the same place.\r\n\r\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\r\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\n\r\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\r\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\r\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\r\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\r\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\r\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\r\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\r\nthe executable.\r\n\r\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\r\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\r\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\r\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\r\ndistribute.\r\n\r\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\r\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\r\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\r\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\r\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\r\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\r\n\r\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\r\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\r\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\r\n    Sections above.\r\n\r\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\r\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\r\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n\r\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\r\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\r\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\r\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\r\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\r\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\r\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\r\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Library or works based on it.\r\n\r\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\r\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\r\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\r\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\r\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\r\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\r\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\r\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\nimpose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\r\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\r\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\r\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\r\nwritten in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\r\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\r\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\r\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\r\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\r\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\r\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\r\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\r\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\r\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\r\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\r\nand reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\n                            NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\r\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\r\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\r\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\r\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\r\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\r\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\r\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\r\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\r\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\r\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\r\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\r\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\r\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\r\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\r\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\r\nDAMAGES.\r\n\r\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\r\n\r\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\r\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\r\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\r\nordinary General Public License).\r\n\r\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\r\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\r\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\r\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\r\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\r\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\r\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\r\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\r\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301\r\n    USA\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\r\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if\r\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\r\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random\r\n  Hacker.\r\n\r\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\r\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it!"

Additional Definitions.\r\n\r\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\r\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\r\nGeneral Public License.\r\n\r\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\r\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\r\n\r\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\r\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\r\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\r\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\r\n\r\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\r\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\r\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\r\nVersion\".\r\n\r\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\r\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\r\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\r\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\r\n\r\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\r\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\r\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\r\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\r\n\r\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\r\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\r\n\r\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\r\n\r\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\r\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\r\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\r\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\r\nversion:\r\n\r\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\r\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\r\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\r\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\r\n\r\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\r\n   this License applicable to that copy.\r\n\r\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\r\n\r\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\r\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\r\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\r\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\r\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\r\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\r\n\r\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\r\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\r\n   covered by this License.\r\n\r\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\r\n   document.\r\n\r\n  4. Combined Works.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\r\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\r\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\r\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\r\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\r\n   covered by this License.\r\n\r\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\r\n   document.\r\n\r\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\r\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\r\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\r\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\r\n\r\n   d) Do one of the following:\r\n\r\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\r\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\r\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\r\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\r\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\r\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\r\n       Corresponding Source.\r\n\r\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\r\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\r\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\r\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\r\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\r\n       Version.\r\n\r\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\r\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\r\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\r\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\r\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\r\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\r\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\r\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\r\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\r\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\r\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\r\n\r\n  5. Combined Libraries.\r\n\r\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\r\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\r\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\r\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\r\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\r\n\r\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\r\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\r\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\r\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\r\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n\r\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\r\n\r\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\r\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\r\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\r\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\r\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\r\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\r\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\r\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\r\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\r\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\r\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\r\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\r\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\r\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\r\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\r\nLibrary."

    "body": "The LaTeX Project Public License\r\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\r\n\r\nLPPL Version 1.3c  2008-05-04\r\n\r\nCopyright 1999 2002-2008 LaTeX3 Project\r\n    Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this\r\n    license document, but modification of it is not allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREAMBLE\r\n========\r\n\r\nThe LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under\r\nwhich the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.\r\n\r\nYou may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright\r\nand which you wish to distribute.  This license may be particularly\r\nsuitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but\r\nit is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is\r\nunrelated to TeX.\r\n\r\nThe section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',\r\nbelow, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors\r\nwho are considering distributing their works under this license.\r\n\r\nThis license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed\r\nand modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of\r\nthat work may be distributed.\r\n\r\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you\r\nthe freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work\r\nthat conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\r\nmaintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of\r\nthat work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while\r\nmeeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'\r\nand `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS\r\n===========\r\n\r\nIn this license document the following terms are used:\r\n\r\n   `Work'\r\n    Any work being distributed under this License.\r\n\r\n   `Derived Work'\r\n    Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.\r\n\r\n   `Modification'\r\n    Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable\r\n    law -- for example, the production of a file containing an\r\n    original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of\r\n    such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\r\n    translated into another language.\r\n\r\n   `Modify'\r\n    To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any\r\n    applicable law.\r\n\r\n   `Distribution'\r\n    Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in\r\n    whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)\r\n    making any electronic components of the Work accessible by\r\n    file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file\r\n    systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).\r\n\r\n   `Compiled Work'\r\n    A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it\r\n    is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may\r\n    include using installation facilities provided by the Work,\r\n    transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or\r\n    other activities.  Note that modification of any installation\r\n    facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.\r\n\r\n   `Current Maintainer'\r\n    A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is\r\n    no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under\r\n    any applicable law.\r\n\r\n   `Base Interpreter'\r\n    A program or process that is normally needed for running or\r\n    interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.\r\n\r\n    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these\r\n    are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each\r\n    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used\r\n    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the\r\n    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a\r\n    `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the\r\n    `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n===========================================\r\n\r\n1.  Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work\r\nare not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In\r\nparticular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no\r\nrequirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.\r\n\r\n2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you\r\nreceived it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered\r\nmodification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived\r\nWork may be assumed under the terms of this clause.\r\n\r\n3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a\r\ncomplete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2\r\nabove, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that\r\nthe recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly\r\nas it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work\r\ndirectly from the Work.\r\n\r\n4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without\r\nrestriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may\r\nalso distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including\r\nCompiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works\r\ndistributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to\r\nbe updated versions of the Work.\r\n\r\n5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify\r\nyour copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,\r\nand compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on\r\nthe Derived Work.\r\n\r\n6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\r\ndistribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met\r\nfor every component of the Work unless that component clearly states\r\nin the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only\r\nthe Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption\r\nto a component of the Work.\r\n\r\n  a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement\r\n     for a component of the Work when that component is used with the\r\n     Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work\r\n     identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that\r\n     Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work\r\n     clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version\r\n     of this component to the user when used interactively with that\r\n     Base Interpreter.\r\n\r\n  b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices\r\n     detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a\r\n     prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part\r\n     of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log\r\n     of the changes.\r\n\r\n  c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,\r\n     including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version\r\n     of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)\r\n     the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the\r\n     Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that\r\n     they do provide such support for the Derived Work.\r\n\r\n  d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:\r\n\r\n       1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work;\r\n          if your distribution of a modified component is made by\r\n          offering access to copy the modified component from a\r\n          designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\r\n          the Work from the same or some similar place meets this\r\n          condition, even though third parties are not compelled to\r\n          copy the Work along with the modified component;\r\n\r\n       2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,\r\n          unmodified copy of the Work.\r\n\r\n7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\r\ndistribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as\r\nthe Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled\r\nWork, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with\r\nregard to the Derived Work.\r\n\r\n8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not\r\napply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it\r\nbecomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as\r\nit is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.\r\n\r\n9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative\r\nformat, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is\r\nthen produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or\r\nnullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of\r\napplying that process.\r\n\r\n10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license\r\n       provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in\r\n       Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have\r\n       to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.\r\n\r\n    b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that\r\n       Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of\r\n       itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the\r\n       restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.\r\n\r\n11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to\r\nthe Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating\r\nsuch works with the Work by any means.\r\n\r\n12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent\r\ncomplete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThere is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in\r\nwriting, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without\r\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not\r\nlimited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a\r\nparticular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance\r\nof the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you assume\r\nthe cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\r\n\r\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing\r\nwill The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the\r\nWork, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as\r\npermitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,\r\nspecial, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of\r\nthe Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited\r\nto, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by\r\nanyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other\r\nprograms), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other\r\nparty has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE OF THE WORK\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nThe Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder\r\nexplicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in\r\nthe Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder\r\nor simply that it is `author-maintained'.\r\n\r\nThe Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer\r\nwho has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error\r\nreports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail\r\naddress). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge\r\nor act upon these error reports.\r\n\r\nThe Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there\r\nis no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current\r\nMaintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means\r\nof communication for a period of six months, and there are no other\r\nsignificant signs of active maintenance.\r\n\r\nYou can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with\r\nany existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.\r\n\r\nIf the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of\r\nthe Work through the following steps:\r\n\r\n 1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and\r\n     the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of\r\n     an Internet or similar search.\r\n\r\n 2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work\r\n     is still maintained.\r\n\r\n  a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer\r\n     to update their communication data within one month.\r\n\r\n  b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active\r\n     maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce\r\n     within the pertinent community your intention to take over\r\n     maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be\r\n     done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)\r\n\r\n 3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass\r\n     maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect\r\n     immediately upon announcement.\r\n\r\n  b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright\r\n     Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,\r\n     then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.\r\n\r\n 4.  If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above\r\n     and after three months your intention is challenged neither by\r\n     the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other\r\n     people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as\r\n     to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.\r\n\r\n 5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes\r\n     reachable once more within three months of a change completed\r\n     under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must\r\n     become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided\r\n     they then update their communication data within one month.\r\n\r\nA change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact\r\nthat the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.\r\n\r\nIf you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should\r\nimmediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous\r\nstatement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also\r\nannounce your new status to the same pertinent community as\r\nin 2b) above.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and\r\nrecommendations for authors who are considering distributing their\r\nworks under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in\r\nthis section.\r\n\r\nChoosing This License or Another License"

Many databases are covered by\r\ncopyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some\r\njurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that\r\ncover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally,\r\nthe ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to\r\nact in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.\r\n\r\nDatabases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,\r\naudiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),\r\nand so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the\r\ncontents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL\r\ntogether with another license for the contents, if the contents have a\r\nsingle set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the\r\ncontents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should\r\ndescribe what rights govern what contents together in the individual\r\nrecord or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.\r\n\r\nSometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be\r\ncovered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,\r\ntrade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights\r\nover information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may\r\nhave to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing\r\nactivities not covered by this License."

Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\r\nnon-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n  a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a\r\n  collective work;\r\n\r\n  b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original\r\n  Work, thereby creating derivative works (\"Derivative Works\") based upon the\r\n  Original Work;\r\n\r\n  c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative\r\n  Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or\r\n  Derivative Works that You distribute or communicate shall be licensed under\r\n  this Open Software License;\r\n\r\n  d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\r\n\r\n  e) to display the Original Work publicly.\r\n\r\n2) Grant of Patent License.

The term \"Source Code\" means the preferred\r\nform of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available\r\ndocumentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to\r\nprovide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along\r\nwith each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor\r\nreserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable\r\ncopy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to\r\npermit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor\r\ncontinues to distribute the Original Work.\r\n\r\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names\r\nof any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or\r\nservice marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\r\nOriginal Work without express prior permission of the Licensor.

No license is granted to the trademarks\r\nof Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in\r\nthis License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under\r\nterms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise\r\nwould have a right to license.\r\n\r\n5) External Deployment. The term \"External Deployment\" means the use,\r\ndistribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any\r\nway such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone\r\nother than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those\r\npersons or made available as an application intended for use over a network.\r\nAs an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat\r\nany External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a\r\ndistribution under section 1(c).\r\n\r\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative\r\nWorks that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the\r\nSource Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any\r\ndescriptive text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause\r\nthe Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent\r\nAttribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have\r\nmodified the Original Work.\r\n\r\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty.

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK\r\nIS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this\r\nLicense. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except\r\nunder this disclaimer.\r\n\r\n8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,\r\nwhether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the\r\nLicensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or\r\nconsequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or\r\nthe use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss\r\nof goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\nother commercial damages or losses.

If You distribute or communicate\r\ncopies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable\r\neffort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to\r\nthe terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake\r\nthe activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative\r\nWorks based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms\r\nand conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty.\r\nNothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and\r\nlimitations (including \"fair use\" or \"fair dealing\").

This License shall terminate automatically\r\nand You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this\r\nLicense as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or\r\ncounterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work\r\ninfringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action\r\nalleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other\r\nsoftware or hardware.\r\n\r\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this\r\nLicense may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the\r\nLicensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under\r\nthe laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The\r\napplication of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\r\nInternational Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original\r\nWork outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be\r\nsubject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the\r\nappropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or\r\nseeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to\r\nrecover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable\r\nattorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including\r\nany appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be\r\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary\r\nto make it enforceable.\r\n\r\n14) Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this License,\r\nwhether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity\r\nexercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License.\r\nFor legal entities, \"You\" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by,\r\nor is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition,\r\n\"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or\r\nmanagement of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership\r\nof fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial\r\nownership of such entity.\r\n\r\n15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise\r\nrestricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not\r\nto interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\r\n\r\n16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence\r\nRosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License\r\nwithout modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this\r\nLicense as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You\r\nmay modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your\r\nmodified version (the \"Modified License\") and apply it to other original works\r\nof authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in\r\nany way that your Modified License is the \"Open Software License\" or \"OSL\" and\r\nyou may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You\r\nmust replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice\r\n\"Licensed under <insert your license name here>\" or with a notice of your own\r\nthat is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You\r\nmay not claim that your original works are open source software unless your\r\nModified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You\r\ncomply with its license review and certification process."

    "body": "VIM LICENSE\r\n\r\nI)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of [project]\r\n    except that they must include this license text.  You can also distribute\r\n    unmodified parts of [project], likewise unrestricted except that they must\r\n    include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables\r\n    that you made from the unmodified [project] sources, plus your own usage\r\n    examples and Vim scripts.\r\n\r\nII) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of [project],\r\n    including executables and/or source code, when the following four\r\n    conditions are met:\r\n    1) This license text must be included unmodified.\r\n    2) The modified [project] must be distributed in one of the following five\r\n       ways:\r\n       a) If you make changes to [project] yourself, you must clearly describe\r\n          in the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks\r\n          you (in any way) for a copy of the modified [project] you\r\n          distributed, you must make your changes, including source code,\r\n          available to the maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves\r\n          the right to include your changes in the official version of\r\n          [project].  What the maintainer will do with your changes and under\r\n          what license they will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has\r\n          been no negotiation then this license, or a later version, also\r\n          applies to your changes. The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar\r\n          <Bram@vim.org>.  If this changes it will be announced in appropriate\r\n          places (most likely vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).\r\n          When it is completely impossible to contact the maintainer, the\r\n          obligation to send him your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has\r\n          confirmed that he has received your changes they will not have to be\r\n          sent again.\r\n       b) If you have received a modified [project] that was distributed as\r\n          mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it\r\n          unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the\r\n          text under a) applies to those changes.\r\n       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of\r\n          the modified [project] you distribute.  This may be done in the form\r\n          of a context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code\r\n          you add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others\r\n          from making their own changes to the official version of [project].\r\n       d) When you have a modified [project] which includes changes as\r\n          mentioned under c), you can distribute it without the source code\r\n          for the changes if the following three conditions are met:\r\n          - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute\r\n            the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and\r\n            permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official\r\n            version of [project] without fee or restriction.\r\n          - You keep the changes for at least three years after last\r\n            distributing the corresponding modified [project].  When the\r\n            maintainer or someone who you distributed the modified [project]\r\n            to asks you (in any way) for the changes within this period, you\r\n            must make them available to him.\r\n          - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This\r\n            contact information must remain valid for at least three years\r\n            after last distributing the corresponding modified [project], or\r\n            as long as possible.\r\n       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,\r\n          you can distribute the modified [project] under the GNU GPL version\r\n          2 or any later version.\r\n    3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the \":version\"\r\n       command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified\r\n       [project] is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as\r\n       mentioned under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as\r\n       this does not conflict with the license used for the changes.\r\n    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be\r\n       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make\r\n       corrections.\r\n\r\nIII) If you distribute a modified version of [project], you are encouraged to\r\n     use the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the\r\n     maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is\r\n     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL. If\r\n     the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a\r\n     context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is\r\n     <maintainer@vim.org>\r\n\r\nIV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the\r\n     [project] sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use\r\n     this license for previous [project] releases instead of the license that\r\n     they came with, at your option."
